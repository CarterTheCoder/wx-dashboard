# What is this?

wx-dashboard is a website that simplifies current, past, and future weather information from the Storm Prediction Center and National Weather Service.

# How do I use this?

You can go to [carterthecoder.github.io/wx-dashboard](carterthecoder.github.io/wx-dashboard) or clone this repository and view the HTML file directly.

# Why?

I wanted an easy way to view NWS's and SPC's weather info quickly.
